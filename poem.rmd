When I come to the end of the road  
And the sun has set for me  
I want no rites in a gloom filled room  
Why cry for a soul set free?   
Miss me a little, but not for long   
And not with your head bowed low  
Remember the love that once we shared  
Miss me, but let me go.  
For this is a journey we all must take  
And each must go alone.  
Itâ€™s all part of the master plan  
A step on the road to home.  
When you are lonely and sick at heart  
Go the friends we know.  
Laugh at all the things we used to do   
Miss me, but let me go.
